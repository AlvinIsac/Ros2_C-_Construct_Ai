# IMPORTANT: Asset Folder Considerations
# 
# Option 1: Hide assets folder (Current setup)
# - Assets folder will not be uploaded to GitHub
# - README.md images will NOT display on GitHub
# - Repository will be clean but without visual demonstrations
#
# Option 2: Include assets folder (Recommended)
# - Comment out the "assets/" line below
# - All images will display properly on GitHub
# - Full visual showcase of your ROS2 skills
#
# To switch to Option 2, comment out this line:
assets/
